# My PHP Site Template

A combination of libraries and basic setup to create an active PHP website using HTML5, CSS, PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, Mustach.

## Uses and Reuse

This template I have used to start a few website projects and added to this over time. You are free to use it and make modifications. I don't use it as often anymore so some libaries are out of date and may need to be updated. I tried to keep things lightweight and fast so there is less to mantain and not get too complicated.
